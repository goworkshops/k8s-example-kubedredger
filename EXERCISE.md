# Exercise: Play around kind and kubectl

The goal this time is to play around and learn the basics.

## 1. Inspect the nodes

Which nodes do kubectl report? which containers is docker running?

## 2. Peek at processes

Which process can you see from your host environment? What about the "nodes"?

## 3. Inspect pods and namespaces

Which pods are running? on which namespaces? check their YAMLs

## 4. Get container logs

How can we get container logs? get logs from a component.

## 5. Create an example pod

Create and delete an example pod. Check `pod.yaml`.

## 6. Mutate some object

Try to add custom labels to a node, or to a pod.
